iOSBabylon
===============================

Starter project for running BabylonJS WebGL engine using iOS and WKWebView.
This is still a "hacky" work in progress solution to include the source files
instead of using a webserver.

PD: Use iPhone6+ simulator, it gets better framerates than the others at the simulator, actual devices perform much better than the simulator.
